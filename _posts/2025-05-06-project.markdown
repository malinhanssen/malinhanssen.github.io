## Who is more prone to have Alzhaimer's disease?

# Introduction

# Dataset

# Logistic regression

To identify the variables that significantly contribute to an Alzheimer's disease diagnosis, we performed a logistic regression analysis. Logistic regression is a statistical method used to model the probability of a binary outcome based on one or more predictor variables. We applied both forward selection and backward elimination, and in both cases, we reached the same conclusion: only age, family history, and genetic risk factors significantly contribute to a positive diagnosis.

As shown in the plot, the probability of having the disease increases with age. A family history of Alzheimer's adds approximately 18% to the probability of diagnosis at age 70. Similarly, the presence of genetic risk factors increases the probability by about 28% at the same age.

In our further analysis, we will focus only on these three factors, as they are the only ones deemed relevant.

Although there was only a minimal correlation between Alzheimer's diagnosis and country of about 0.02, we found that some there were noticable differences in the ratio of patient's with Alzheimer compared to without. There are three groupings with similar ratio values. We wanted to investigate further in order to understand why.

The age distribution, ratio of family history and ratio of genetic risk factor are all quite similar for the different nations. There are no remarkable differences so we can rule out that any of these are the cause of the difference in number of diagnoses.
