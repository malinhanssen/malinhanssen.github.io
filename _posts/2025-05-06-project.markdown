## Who is more prone to have Alzhaimer's disease?

# Introduction

Alzheimer’s disease is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder that affects millions of individuals worldwide, leading to cognitive decline and memory loss. Understanding the factors that contribute to its onset is crucial for early detection and targeted intervention.

This project aims to answer the following research question: **Who is more prone to have Alzheimer’s disease?** To address this, a global dataset was analyzed containing a diverse range of demographic, lifestyle, environmental, and genetic variables. Rather than focusing solely on clinical symptoms, the analysis emphasizes social and behavioral aspects—such as physical activity, stress, education, and social engagement—that may influence the likelihood of diagnosis.

By applying statistical analysis and interactive visualizations, the project investigates how these variables contribute to diagnosis outcomes and how they vary across different regions and populations.



# Dataset

The primary dataset used in this project is the [Alzheimer’s Prediction Dataset (Global)](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/ankushpanday1/alzheimers-prediction-dataset-global/data). Each record contains a wide range of variables, including demographic information (age, gender, education), lifestyle factors (physical activity, smoking, alcohol use), psychological and social metrics (stress, sleep quality, social engagement), and limited genetic and clinical indicators (e.g., APOE-ε4 presence, cognitive score, diagnosis outcome).

Although the dataset includes some medically relevant features, the analysis in this project primarily focuses on social, behavioral, and environmental variables rather than digging deep into clinical or neurological data. This direction was chosen to better understand how broader life conditions and societal contexts relate to Alzheimer’s diagnosis patterns globally.

In addition to the individual-level dataset, country-level data on healthcare system quality was incorporated to explore potential structural contributors to diagnosis rates. This includes metrics such as access, infrastructure, and national health investment, which were used in the “Health care systems in different countries” section to compare diagnosis patterns in relation to healthcare quality.

# Logistic regression

To identify the variables that significantly contribute to an Alzheimer's disease diagnosis, a logistic regression analysis was performed. Logistic regression is a statistical method used to model the probability of a binary outcome based on one or more predictor variables. Both forward selection and backward elimination were applied, and in both cases, the same conclusion was reached: only age, family history, and genetic risk factors significantly contribute to a positive diagnosis.

As shown in the plot, the probability of having the disease increases with age. A family history of Alzheimer's adds approximately 18% to the probability of diagnosis at age 70. Similarly, the presence of genetic risk factors increases the probability by about 28% at the same age.

In the further analysis, only these three factors will be considered, as they are the only ones deemed relevant.

# Typical patient

To better understand the characteristics associated with Alzheimer’s disease, a comparative analysis between diagnosed and non-diagnosed individuals was conducted. This helped define a profile of a “typical” Alzheimer’s patient based on key demographic, genetic, and lifestyle variables.

Individuals diagnosed with Alzheimer’s tend to be older, typically above 70 years of age. A higher presence of the APOE-ε4 genetic risk factor and a family history of Alzheimer’s disease is common among these patients. Differences were also observed in lifestyle indicators, with diagnosed individuals reporting lower physical activity levels, increased stress, and reduced social engagement.

These contrasts were visualized using targeted plots, which made the distinctions between the two groups more interpretable.

# Alzheimer's disease in the world

A global view of Alzheimer’s diagnosis rates was also explored by aggregating data at the country level. An interactive choropleth map was created to visualize how diagnosis rates vary across regions.

The results show significant disparities between countries. Some countries, particularly those with robust healthcare systems, report higher diagnosis rates. In contrast, lower rates in other regions may reflect underdiagnosis due to limited access to medical care or differences in public health infrastructure.

The map includes an age filter, allowing users to observe how diagnosis rates change across age groups. This geographic perspective highlights that Alzheimer’s disease is influenced not only by individual risk factors but also by broader systemic and healthcare-related conditions.

# Ratio of Alzheimer's disease in different countries

To further explore the slightly different color nuances observed in the global map, we examined the proportion of individuals diagnosed with Alzheimer’s disease within each country. The bar plot below presents these diagnosis ratios, offering a clearer, side-by-side comparison across countries.

In the plot above the following was observe: 
* The yellow group (Japan, Canada, Sweden, Norway) had the lowest ratios, ranging from 33.94% to 34.97%.
* The blue group followed, with moderately higher ratios between 38.64% and 41.59%.
* Finally, the orange group (India, Russia, South Africa, Brazil, Mexico) showed the highest ratios, ranging from 48.47% to 50.45%. 
* The gap between the lowest (Japan, 33.94%) and the highest (Russia, 50.45%) is significant, a difference of 16.51 percentage points. These variations prompted us to investigate further to better understand the underlying causes.

The age distribution, prevalence of family history, and ratio of genetic risk factors appear consistent across the different countries. Since there are no significant differences in these variables, we can rule them out as explanations for the variation in Alzheimer’s diagnoses. Given that these aspects are not major differentiators, what other factors could be driving these differences?

# Health care systems in different countries

The theory was that the external factor, the health care system, could be part of the answer. One way of assessing health care systems is by looking at the health care index. There are many different systems for measuring and comparing these values, therefore we look at 3 different rating systems: Numbeo, CEOWORLD, and European Commission. Numbeo's dataset from 2025 considers factors such as "medical professionals, equipment, staff, doctors, and costs. It provides an assessment of the healthcare infrastructure, services, and resources available in a specific location." [1]. The CEOWorld dataset from 2024 healthcare infrastructure, healthcare professionals competencies, cost, quality medicine availability, and government readiness [2]. The European Commission's dataset from 2018 has "Findings from the Global Burden of Disease (GBD) study are used to estimate a summary measure of healthcare access and quality." [3]

The researchers used different scales, so all three were normalized to allow for comparison, and an average health care index was created.

<div style="width: 800px; margin: 0 auto;">
    <iframe src="/assets/html/health_index_plot.html" width="100%" height="500px" frameborder="0"></iframe>
</div>  

The Pearson correlation coefficient was calculated to assess the linear relationship between a country’s Alzheimer’s diagnosis ratio and its health system quality, using both average health index scores and ranks. For the average score, the correlation was r = -0.685, p = 0.001, indicating a moderately strong, statistically significant negative relationship. In contrast, the correlation with average rank was r = 0.788, p = 0.00004, reflecting a strong positive relationship. These results suggest that countries with better health systems — reflected in higher scores and better (i.e., lower) ranks — tend to have lower proportions of Alzheimer’s diagnoses in this dataset.

This may be the case for several reasons. Three possible explanations are proposed (though there are certainly others).
1. Stronger health systems support better prevention and early-life care. Countries with high-performing health systems often implement effective preventive strategies targeting cardiovascular health, diabetes, and other lifestyle-related risk factors — all known to influence dementia risk. These interventions extend beyond individual behavior and include systemic, long-term public health efforts that may not be fully captured in the dataset [4]. Even if your dataset includes lifestyle data at a single point in time, Alzheimer’s risk is shaped by decades of vascular and metabolic health [5] [6]. 
2. According to the World Health Organization (WHO), dementia — including Alzheimer’s — is significantly underdiagnosed in many low- and middle-income countries. This is due to lack of awareness, limited training of healthcare workers, poor access to specialist care, cultural stigma around cognitive decline. In addition, “Alzheimer’s” may be used as a catch-all diagnosis for any form of cognitive decline due to limited diagnostic tools or expertise. This can result in both underdiagnosis and overdiagnosis of Alzheimer’s specifically when it is used as the default label for undifferentiated symptoms [7].
3. Skewed sample or dataset bias. The dataset may disproportionately reflect people with severe cognitive symptoms — especially in countries with limited healthcare access, where only the most severe cases reach clinical attention. This could lead to overrepresentation of Alzheimer’s among diagnosed cases, and underrepresentation of milder, mixed, or non-Alzheimer’s dementias, which may be more frequently diagnosed in higher-resourced systems with better diagnostic capacity.

# Conclution
To address the research question—**Who is more prone to have Alzheimer’s disease?**—this project analyzed demographic, lifestyle, and genetic variables to identify patterns associated with a diagnosis. Logistic regression revealed that age, family history of Alzheimer’s, and the presence of the APOE-ε4 genetic risk factor are the strongest individual predictors of a positive diagnosis. These findings were further supported by visualizations showing that individuals with Alzheimer's tend to be older and more likely to have these risk factors.

On a global level, an interactive choropleth map showed disparities in diagnosis rates between countries. Countries with more developed healthcare systems—such as the United States and several European nations—tended to report higher rates of Alzheimer’s diagnoses. This suggests that access to healthcare, diagnostic infrastructure, and awareness play a significant role in detection.

However, it's important to interpret these findings critically. Higher diagnosis rates may not necessarily reflect a higher true prevalence, but rather better access to diagnostic services. In contrast, underreporting in lower-resource settings may mask the actual burden of the disease. This raises concerns about global health equity and highlights the importance of strengthening diagnostic capacity in underrepresented regions.

In conclusion, individuals who are older, genetically predisposed, and have a family history are more prone to developing Alzheimer’s disease. But the probability of being diagnosed also depends heavily on where a person lives and the resources available to detect the disease. This underscores the dual importance of personal risk factors and structural health inequalities in shaping our understanding of Alzheimer’s disease globally.
